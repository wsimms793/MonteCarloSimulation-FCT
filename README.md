# MonteCarloSimulation-FCT
A report for FCT, evaluating the costs and emissions of the charity running on biofuel alternatives to diesel.
## Overview
This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation developed as part of a university project.
The goal of the project is to model and analyze the cost and emissions of FCT running on biofuel alternatives to Diesel.


The project was done with complete freedom and choice of project, its only need was to be related to Fermangh Community Transport.


## Project Structure
- `src/` – Source code for the Monte Carlo simulation
- `figures/` – Plots and figures generated from the simulations
- `paper/` – Final written report (PDF)
